Your task is to generate a JSON object with two keys: "bad_messages" and "good_messages".

- For the "bad_messages" key, provide a list of {num_messages} text messages that are clickbait-y and exhibit multiple red flags commonly associated with scams for selling popular items. Use the {{link}} placeholder in these messages.
- For the "good_messages" key, provide a list of {num_messages} text messages that are informative, trustworthy, and completely free of any scam-like red flags. Do not use the {{link}} placeholder in these messages.

Please ensure the final output is a single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text before or after the JSON object. The separation between "good" and "bad" messages is important

Here is an example of the desired output format for num_messages = 1:

{{
  "bad_messages": [
    "URGENT: Your account is compromised! Click {{link}} to secure it NOW!"
  ],
  "good_messages": [
    "Your package has been shipped and will arrive in 3-5 business days."
  ]
}}
